WTF you're on the series what the future what the future aims to dive deep into hot topics that you the youth may be scratching your heads about.
Basically, we asked tough questions so you don't have to what the?
What's up guys? Welcome to another episode of WTF what the future so what is the future is yet to be seen? Yeah, it's really yet to be seen. I think today, you know, we're going to deep dive into a topic that really, you know, has spanned our entire lifetime from zero to 100. It's digitalization,
yes. Honestly, I have no idea what that is. But what the future is a podcast series brought to you by the National Youth Council in partnership with the Singapore Institute of International Affairs. And I think that we really need to dive into this because I am very confused about what it is
we can't exist without technology these days. And I think both of them very interconnected. Right. But what does that mean for the UC states because the digital world is moving at a pace that so fast, I kind of wrap my head around it. Luckily, today,
we're joined by two experts in this field. Digitalization.
That's right. We've got the Director of Strategy for a Tech for Good, Mr. Martin. Well, hello. Yes, he is also the co founder and CTO of a critici. Mr. Derek. Hello.
Thank you guys for joining us today. So let's talk a little bit about what you guys do in your field of work. Yeah,
well, I'm the Technical Institute is a fairly new institute is about one year and running. The intention of the institute is really to drive research as well as dialogues on how can we shape the trajectory of growth in the digital economy for Southeast Asia? There's a lot of excitement in the region. And so as the work is going on in the digital economy, so how do we navigate some of these things together as a society, that's something that the Technical Institute does. So through the work of the whole year, this year, we've been able to interact with many entrepreneurs, many policymakers, as well as us, who are at the forefront of driving this change.
Cool. Glad to hear that Martin and Derek, what about critici
we work directly with the source to issue verifiable and digital credentials. So what that means now is the schools are able to issue verifiable and digital transcripts and certificates directly to the students. And the students. If they lose it, they can easily redownload. And they can easily share it with prospective employers. And all employers need to do is just verify instantaneously without the need to go to the school or any other forms of verification. And yeah, same thing applies for healthcare, the healthcare institutions can issue those COVID-19 test results directly to you. And before you fly, you can just go to the airport present a QR code, and you can get boarded. So we're kind of in like, the trust layer. Yeah.
Thank you for that. Oh, my God basically
meet everybody's lives easier.
Thank you for your contribution. Yeah, but you know, digitalization this word, right? It's become a buzzword in recent years, but I can't quite wrap my head around it. Oh,
I think the first it's important to recognize a few things, right. Number one, it's why it's been a topic of great interest is because if digitalization and technology there's this whole entire premise that there's a great deal of promise that brings society, right, to empower people, provide them the earning opportunities, and thereby just be able to improve their lives at scale, and be able to do that at scale and fast in a generation or rather in a time that we have never been able to see before. And I think it'll continue to be so just because of the impact and the skills and has to the broader society at large.
If I were to talk about digitalization in the last two years, right, I would say the COVID 19 pandemic definitely impacted digitalization a lot. I think on one hand, it accelerated the adoption of digital tools in many industries. So for example, businesses had to quickly adapt to remote work and social distancing measures. So that's where all our video conferencing tools and online collaboration platforms came into play. And that helped people to work from home easier. And then there's also the growth of E commerce and contactless payment have made it possible for people to shop and pay for goods and services without ever being physically at the store or in the country for some people. But on the other hand, the pandemic also highlighted the digital divide, and the challenges faced by some individuals and communities when it comes to assessing digital technologies, for example, people who do not have laptops, people who lack high speed internet access, or people who just do not have the necessary digital skills, and these people may struggle to fully participate in the digital economy. So I think, overall, the pandemic has both accelerated but also exposed the challenges of digitalization.
That's actually a very good point. Right, because right as you're speaking of this right, we know that digitalization has brought along many challenges along with opportunities. But what are some of these things that you could touch on?
I think when it comes to opportunities, first, we already know that digitalization is widely accepted, and really widely used. So people would know that going digital would bring about increase efficiency and productivity. Right now it's easier to share information and access information. It's easier to connect with people from overseas and collaborate with them. And I think something really cool is there's no physical boundaries anymore. So your surgeons are able to perform surgery using remote robotic surgery. Yeah, and I mean, we also see at home and other stuff online, right. It's possible a couple years ago, I was at this talk, and this company, what they were trying to do, they were basically an audit company. And they have to be physically present at the place where they have to audit, right. But they all they had to do was just get one of the employees to wear all these three AI goggles. They could just do the audit without being physically there. So it's really, really cool. But you see, with opportunities come challenges. And the problem is the same set of opportunities can apply the same for bad actors. So now it is easier for them to spread fake news or create deep fakes that can create mass confusion, and which is why there's also a rise in online scams. And, of course, the digital divide that i i mentioned earlier.
Yeah, I think it's important to also maybe highlight some of the stats, just to give everyone a bit of a flavor as to what's actually going on today. In Southeast Asia, we have heard a lot about the momentum of people going online and all that stuff. So I think to cite some of the stats have come out from the work done by our friends at Bing, Google and tamasic. Thus far 25% of the population service Asia still isn't online, although in Singapore is pretty much everyone is that's almost 100 and 50 million, if you're talking about in Southeast Asia, that's the size of legit and Japan and Mexico 100 and 50 million people still do not have access to internet. And just slightly over one in three of the small and medium enterprises. I'm talking about the the Hawker stores that you see across Singapore and Malaysia. The bank is also what we call the Mechanix. In Indonesia, the sari sari stores across Philippines who still do not use online technology at all.
Because if you think about it, I believe the mobile penetration rate in Singapore is more than 100%, which means that a lot of people in Singapore have more than one phone Exactly. But then 150 million people in Southeast Asia are not even on the grid.
Now. In addition to that, then there is this whole issue of the underbanked and unbanked where six intense service agents are still in that category. But there is also deadlines to opportunities for us to serve, right? For the technopreneurs. The change makers, the US are listening in right is that here like this is where innovation to digitalization can come in, and not just on the cutting edge of technology where all the fancy gadget stuff that does that but also innovations in business model. So perhaps I wanted to just share three areas where I think will be quite interesting for those listening in to focus attention on I think the first it's the whole issue of FinTech, right? The entire FinTech world is now it's insane. There's lots of developments going on. What do I mean by that? Everything's on micro, you can do micro payments, micro insurance, micro loans, everything can be done micro. And this is only possible because of technology. The second one is what we call the delivery tech, anything that serves you from point to point, and we're not just talking about bring you as a person from point A to point B, but also goods from point A to point B, information from point A to point B delivery. That's something that we see because it expands opportunities for people to reach out to new segments blockchain x. Well, I guess fundamentally the back end of it, but not all. It's also quite complex with Blockchain, let's not go down. That line, it's really the whole issue of Health Tech. And believe it or not, Southeast Asia is one of those regions in the world is very underserved from health care, you know, to many other people and services, you didn't even have access to a clinic, and what more getting access to medication. But now with technology, we're able to augment that and bring them closer to that. And one of the interesting things about these different verticals is the underpinning, it is important work that people like Derek is doing and his team at accredit phi, which is building a layer of trust in the digital economy. We don't trust people will have will be they will cynical about the effects or the promise that technology brings. He also
spoke about the digital divide. And while the youth may be a bit more trusting towards such technologies, I think there comes a generation like the older generation, where there's still a bit hesitant to go full in on this right. How do you think the youth can help them in that regard?
I think youths were born in a generation where we Have some form of digital skills, or at least we grew up with all these tools, so we kind of know how to use them. And what we can do is we don't have to think of it as, how can I help the older generation or all of the older generation at one go, but rather we how can we help our own family, our own grandparents? And I think if everyone does that, then it kind of just, it has a ripple effect. You know, how our parents or grandparents they have their own Whatsapp group, right? So you just need to teach one and then I think they were gonna they're gonna do the same that Whatsapp group that you get your morning message. Morning. But the mean, yeah,  *struggles a lot when more than one person is talking*
I mean, the funny thing is, when we were growing up, our parents would tell us, you know, don't believe everything that you see on the news. Now, we have to believe everything you see on Facebook,
but even assumes, I don't think we are shielded from the same set of risks and problems that currently plagues society. With regards to fraud to scams. And all the misinformation that is there. I think we ourselves need to also remind ourselves that hey, like, we are also subject to the same amount of risk. You know, just because traditional Native doesn't mean we know everything. The world that we know, today will be very different tomorrow or the week later or even a couple of years down the road.
Well, I mean, the both of you are in tech jobs, right? How did you find yourself in a tech job? And did you have any other career before that?
Yeah. So I started coding when I was probably 12 years old. Whoa, I started from one language. There was Java back then. Because I like playing games a lot. And, but what I don't like is putting in the hours to gain a really, really high level and good equipments. So you hack, but I don't have I replicated the original.
Oh, so you did a private server game.
I did a private server Maplestory. Yeah, that was one of it. There were a couple of games that maybe we play in its private server, you probably it was quite popular back then. I was showing it. Yeah. Okay. And I think with that, I started to get a little bit more entrepreneurial. Like I was making money from my private server, I was selling weapons and levels to my friends. I was like, you want to be next level? In one day? Wow.
So that's very interesting. You started out from a young age with an interest in programming from gaming. Yeah. And eventually now, you're a startup on your legitimate. Wow. Yeah. Wow. How can the next generation kind of cultivate this, you know, as we move along?
Firstly, education. Right now we have we can we already have that included in our curriculum? I believe so. And existing workers can continuously upskill themselves, so that we, everyone would have the necessary digital skills to equip for the digital space access. And we were also talking about innovation, I think we can also start to foster the culture of innovation, right from school. So if there are more partnerships between private sector entities and governments and academia, then we can create a digital economy that is more sustainable, innovative and inclusive.
Yeah, I think talking about schools, it'd be a good time to kind of talk about the EAP program as well.
Yeah, I think, you know, that's what we've touched on mister the Asia really exposure program. That's something that allows the youth to have an understanding of, you know, all of these different, like social, cultural, political dimensions of the countries all over Southeast Asia. And you can also learn about, you know, this digital divide all across different cities and be exposed to opportunities beyond just Singapore, because you just think about Singapore is a very narrow minded case view,
I think a good question to ask right now would be that if any of the youth right want to, let's say, join a credit fight, or I want to join, you know, any kind of tech company, and they come up to you, and they say, you know, I'm interested in this, but I don't have any kind of like, digital background, I need tech background, will you still take me in as a employee?
Well, I think that depends on the role that they're applying for. The tech industry is huge. There are a lot of roles. And if you're able to do something like marketing or strategy, business development, then there is always a role for you that doesn't require you to have digital skills at the start. These are things that can be trained on later on.
There's a lot of things you could do in the tech industry that don't necessarily require technical skills. You've got like business management, digital law, government regulations, policy, sustainability marketing, for example. I'll give you an example. I have no digital experience, no technical experience zero, right. But when I was 19, I took an internship in Cambodia, and I was supposed to be an editor for an online tech A blog in Cambodia, called geeks in Cambodia shout out. And I was like, Well, I don't know anything about this, how am I going to contribute to this, but after starting on the job, I, you know, I had to go around interviewing people, I interviewed tech creators who actually started, for example, a mobile app and agricultural app to help rural farmers in Cambodia, understand market prices for their goods. So they know how to price their goods, they know how to stay competitive in the market. And I don't need tech experience to do that. But through my journalistic experience, I'm able to then spread the word about that to the rest of the region,
coming back to this, I think, for the US citizen, and if you feel that he like, I've never had an opportunity to dip my toes in the rule of 10. Given my circumstances, or like, I haven't had the opportunity to do so because sometimes the threshold to enter into these opportunities are quite high. Because everything's so competitive, right? Like, you do not have experience someone else has. So how do you level up to that? Is that actually now, there's a lot of things that you can also do, even without going into these opportunities directly. So say, for example, I always find that, you know, if you're a user of Twitter, you're a user of YouTube, and you see something about it that is like, Hey, this is quite interesting. Like, why are the algorithms such as such? Like, how, why are they not kind of optimizing for me, and you do like a little bit of a one or two pager on like, Okay, this is I think ways in which maybe from the product perspective, you can improve on certain things, and then you, you basically create something out and your LinkedIn is now over, right? And you will find someone who is like in either in YouTube, looking at product where you can identify them and stalk them online, right? And just say, hey, like, I want you to drop your message. Like, I'm from Singapore, you know, this is what I've learned, or like, what I'm observing is a little one pager that might help you in your product design, please, like, this is a suggestion I have from coming from Southeast Asia, I hope that you find it useful. And I think that sends a signal out that you are interested in the field, but you have not been able to get opportunities yet, which is fine. But you are taking proactive steps to get yourself closer. And I think this is the kind of spirit that we need from the US.
Absolutely. I think there's so many ways that you know, the youth can get involved in the tech industry. And that comes with any industry, you can't just sit there and wait for things to fall into your lap. You got to you know, take proactive steps. And with Google these days, you literally have to answer to anything and everything.
I agree. But my question is that, you know, there are so many different tech careers and so many different careers in this industry as well. But it's ever changing. Right? So what can the youth expect for the future of the tech when it comes to careers here? Exactly, yeah.
Well, we all mentioned how it was ever changing, and how fast and fast paced and dynamic it is. So I think as long as you're always updated on the latest trends and technologies, and you stay flexible and adaptable, then I think you're kind of ready for whatever changes that comes along. But I think one very important piece of advice that not directly related to the tech industry, but just for everyone is to really go out and network and connect with other people so that you can create and maintain your own strong social network of luck. And with a strong social network of luck, that will help you to maximize opportunities later in life.
Yep, I can't emphasize the fact on, you know, for those of you are extroverted, how to open the doors for those who are not, you know, open the space a bit more and bring them along. I think that's something that we should all look out for for each other, the world's going to be very difficult and going to be very uncertain. And I think this is where I think just working with each other and continue to be plugged in. I think that something will be useful for us. Yeah,
there is enough of the pie to go around and like methods that kindness goes a long way. So I think that's a very lovely way to end today's podcast. Yes. Thank you very much to Martina, for Derek for joining us today and sharing it with us. You know, you're many escapades from young like coding.
I think we've learned a lot about digitalization and the future as well and what to expect. I think Jimmy and I are very prepared. I got my thinking cap on for to prepare myself for the future as well as my iPhone and iPad.
That's all you need. So thank you very much for joining us on this episode of WTF what the future and next week we are going green, I'm gonna wear
a green t shirt, orange jacket or something
green. Today, we're gonna be talking about sustainability. This has been making its rounds over the past few years and really affects all of us. You know, our future on this earth
especially Yes, remember to go and visit the national youth councils, Facebook and Instagram page and leave your comments about what you think about digitalization that we've all talked about today.
You can also learn more about what's happening in the region and sign up for related events by visiting the Asia ready resource page at youth topia.sg.
Yes, make sure that you check out what they have there and also see what you can plan for your own future because that's digitalization in itself. Thank you do make it. We'll catch you next week on Another episode of what the future
