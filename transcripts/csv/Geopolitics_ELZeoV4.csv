1,0:01,1,Introduction,"WTF you're on the series what the future what the future aims to dive deep into hot topics that you the youth may be scratching your heads about. Basically, we asked tough questions so you don't have to what the? What's up guys and thank you for joining us on another episode of WTF what the future what the future is a podcast series by the national youth councils Asia ready exposure program in partnership with the Singapore Institute of International Affairs. Today, we're gonna be unpacking something that is I don't think we understand much about it. But thankfully, we have some experts here. Um, I'll give you the topic. global geopolitics define it is basically politics and about where the countries are placed on the ah, actually, I think I saw that on Wikipedia. So you actually did research. You did the same thing. I went on Wikipedia, I just guessed. But yes, I think that's, you know, pretty much the broad like sense of what it is, but breaking it down into what's currently happening in the world right now, in terms of global geopolitics. And also, you know, covering a bit of the US China rivalry that we grew up in, right, and it's still happening right now. Yep. So in this episode, we're gonna speak to the experts of geopolitics, obviously, not us, but we're gonna discuss some of the economic impacts on the region and what to expect moving forward. Okay. Joining us in the studio here today. We've got assistant professor at NTU. Public Policy and global affairs, Dillon low, no. We also have your Channel News, Asia executive producer, Miss Pearl force. Okay, so our first question is, obviously, "
1,0:02,1,Question,"how do you get into your field and what piqued your interest in in your, in your field of studies and your field of work?"
1,0:03,2,Body,"So I studied sociology and economics at NUS and how I got interested in China, it was actually very accidental. So in the second year of my university, which is all the way back in 2001, that was a travelogue. There was going to be shot in China, and they were auditioning for people and I was like, yeah, if we traveled to China, I want to do this, right. So I signed up for it. And then I spent two months in China doing all kinds of fun things, like going to Shaolin Temple going for climbing our army visiting different cities, and they were so open and welcoming to foreign ideas, to talking to foreigners, you know, to engaging and I just fell in love with China. And so, of course, you don't go from being a fresh grad, do immediately becoming a documentary producer. So after I graduated two years later, I joined CNA worked in the local news desk. And then I worked for a couple of different production houses. And I went back to China in 2008 to make my first China related documentary, and I haven't stopped since then. "
1,0:04,1,Body,"That's incredible, was amazing. Well, it sounds like you've had really quite the journey, you know, in your career. What about you, Dylan? How did you get into this field of work"
1,0:05,3,Body," very difficult to top. pale in comparison, mine is really very, unexciting. So when I did my undergraduate in sociology to at NTU, but from my first year in undergraduate, I knew I wanted to go into academia. Because I just loved research, it helped that I had a lot of inspiring professors as well. After my undergraduate, I went through my masters and rsis as Rajaratnam School of International Studies. There, I worked for the den Dean, and former ambassador Varidesk it was when it really opened my eyes participating in some of these tracks one track 1.2, which is what we call meetings below the official levels, where I had the chance to interact, see, speak with Chinese interlocutors. And that really made me very interested because even at that time, I could see how some of the practices were slightly different from the rest. And that really made me a very interested in, in developing a topic around China. It helped that my boss back then, and as the former ambassador buried, so it was very welcoming, encouraging. In fact, he said that, go on, go and develop your research topic. And I formulated my research topic around China's diplomats back then this also before the whole wolf warrior diplomacy was seen, I was very interested in Chinese diplomacy, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs just because it's like a black box not been studied a lot. Even within the academic literature. None of people know what they do their effect on Chinese foreign policy, or they have this very traditional view of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs being fairly weak in the Chinese domestic system, but what I found actually was not the case. So after rsis, I got a scholarship to do my PhD at Cambridge came back to NTU in 2019. And here I am, "
1,0:06,1,Body,"you've tried a lot of different things. And you know You kind of chose something that you're very passionate about. Right? And I'm very glad that both of you are speaking with such you know, vibrancy about it. We need it today. Because we're going to be discussing, you know, in this first part, the sino us rivalry, right? This is something that has been described as the most important bilateral relationship of the 21st century. And the situation between both countries has always been complicated and complex. But in the last decade or so, seems like it's become more tense. "
1,0:07,1,Question,"Why do you guys think it's become, you know, the tensions are running so high. "
1,0:08,2,Body,"It's very, very complex, as you pointed out, and there's a lot to unpack, and I could sit here and talk for 10 hours, but I wouldn't. If I had to break it down into just one reason why the US is upset with China. And one reason why China is upset with us amongst the various factors, it would be this. Okay, so we all remember President Trump, right? Yeah. And in 2016, when President Trump was running for presidency, he went to a lot of these Rust Belt states, or middle America, and ran a campaign that said, you don't make America great again, stop letting China steal our jobs. And remember what happened, he won. And we have to understand the historical background of that, which is that when China joined the WTO, China became the factory of the world. "
1,0:09,2,Body,"I'm pretty sure the clothes I'm wearing right now something's made in China, you know, but when everything is made in China, what happens to the American cities and American people who used to make those same things. manufacturers? Yes. Right. So for many, many years, what we've seen is that the, there's been a hollowing out of the American middle class, when all these factories shift to China. And to be fair to other places in the world, but many of them to China, you have the collapse of certain cities. So I filmed in Dayton, Ohio, I also filmed in Detroit, and you go there, and you see these big factories, abandon the communities around, they're jobless. So people are angry, and they're upset. And when you have Trump coming in 2016, and saying make America great again, you know, stop China from unfair trade practices, and currency manipulation, and all of that. It resounded with people. And then he started the trade war, after that. And by the way, those tariffs that were implemented as part of the trade war, a lot of them are still around today, during Biden's administration. But I want to include this very important thing, which is my personal view, is that that is not the full picture. A lot of the job losses were also caused by automation, robots taking over jobs, they also outsource to a lot of places like Southeast Asia, Mexico, India. So it is not entirely fair at all, to blame China, for the hollowing out of the middle class and the loss of so many jobs in the US, I think the US also needs to look at their own problems of inequality, how, you know, the very rich, you know, holding on to a lot of the wealth, but I think it meant many people do hold that view that China's rise has led to a certain degree of economic decline in the States. So on the flip side, right, yes, if we're looking from China to what the US"
1,0:10,2,Body,"Okay, all right. Have you guys been Beijing? Yes. Yes. Have you guys visited this place called the yuanmingyuan ? It's like these gorgeous ruins. Okay. Okay. So, German Yuan is called the Garden of perfect brightness. And it is, it was the most beautiful thing that China had in the 1800s. Okay. And what happened was that the Western forces, came into China, at the height of the Opium War, went to your finger and burned it all down after they looted the place. And this idea of the century of shame that China's suffered under the hands of, you know, Western forces, it's very much part of the psyche, everyday psyche of Chinese people. And so, after so many decades of working so hard, you know, they finally have their place in the sun. And then you have the US then coming and criticizing them that said, oh, you know, you did this due to currency manipulation, unfair trade practices, and all of that it. It really bites, you know, and, and they reference history a lot. And HongKong was another major point and Hong Kong is related to European Union and the Opium War and a century of shame because they lost HongKong during the century of shame, right. And then we all remember the massive protests that were happening in Hong Kong, and we have Chinese leaders and the China China public believing that the US please ate a role in that. I'm not saying that that is the correct point of view. But I'm saying that that is quite a popular belief. And it's also something that's been shared by the Chinese leaders. So all those protests mixed with the history of the century of shame, mixed with, you know, the US targeting China as a rivalry for the reasons that I described earlier all contributes to quite a lot of anger in China. "
1,0:11,1,Question,"I wanted to ask you to learn about this as well, you know, speaking of that, there's always this competition about us being a global superpower. And we know that China is trying to challenge that as well. Do you think that has got anything to play on that whole, you know, China doesn't want to be bullied anymore?"
1,0:12,3,Body,"It certainly has. So in international relations, we have this theory called the hegemonic transition theory, which really, in a nutshell says that a rising power will challenge the status quo power. And that, in return will result in some friction, or some tension, and many are pointing to this point in time. As that very moment will give a another analogy, I have two young kids at home. So I have my eldest daughter who's like the superpower superpower. And then when my youngest came out, that's like the emerging power. And then you will very quickly see the superpower sole superpower when he turned to had all the attention being read unhappy, and this manifests in various ways, tantrums, and whatnot. So in that sense, what we are seeing happening and US China relations, I think speaks to that as well. The US for the longest time has has believed in and tried to socialize China into the international system to make them more like us. So they do this by various means trying to introduce democracy, trade, because the idea is that to have flourishing trade, you must have liberal democracy, because the rules underpinning global trade was slowly permeate society become more democratized, or more democratic, right? Like, it has been very clear that that has not happened, China has proven that you can have authoritarian capitalism, you can have a very capitalist mode of production in the economic sphere with almost zero reforms in the political sphere. And I think, during the Obama years, they have reached a point inflection point where they realize that, okay, China is not going to be a democracy, they are not going to be like us, we are not going to socialize them to be more in our making, we cannot mold them anymore. What next? That's when the strategies are pivot to Asia, then subsequently renamed rebalance to Asia started to coalesce and, and concretize, and has been carried on until the present day, "
1,0:13,1,Question,"do a bit more of a global scale, right? I mean, we're talking about US, China and how they view each other. But how does this rivalry then affect the rest of the world?"
1,0:14,3,Body,"I point out two things. One, the most obvious one is the deleterious economic effects. When Trump initiated the so called trade war, you see some of the negative effects being reflected in stock markets and investor sentiments, in real terms for various economies as well, that has persisted into the Biden administration as well. Of course, what we are experiencing now on a global level is not due only to US, China tensions, but this whole host of other issues, structural issues, war on Ukraine, global inflation, we see some of the runaway ill effects of hyperglobalisation manifesting themselves various way as well. So we cannot blame entirely all the economic woes we're experiencing only on US, China. But what I have to add is that stable US China relations, in many ways, the precursor to global recovery, essentially, no economy in the world will be left untouched. When China or US sneezes, the rest of the world will catch a cold. So the economic aspect is very clear. And it's the most effect, straightforward. And the second point I want to raise is because of the tension brought on by the US China relations, there is a sense, I think, a degradation of a sense of security. People just generally feel less secure, they feel less prosperous, they feel that the world is more hostile as a friendlier place. But this is felt at both levels. I think at the political level. And governments around the world when they keep speaking in summits, or when they make their speeches keep referring to us China tensions is going to have an effect. "
1,0:15,1,Body,Culture is simplified is how we bring this back to the youth. 
1,0:16,3,Body,"Yeah. So I think the economic angle is quite clear when the global economy is not doing well. Singapore being such an open economy, Singapore will get affected economically as well. So that would have a direct impact on job prospects, wage growth, and kinds of industries that you can participate, maybe even retrenchment. We see a little bit of that in the tech sector. On the second point that I made on general sense of insecurity, I think it affects mentally with what's happening, just this very negative atmosphere of what's taking place. He's around different parts of the world. So all of this, I think, also adds to the anxiety that perhaps youths may face today. I think social media definitely helps to play a part in that, you know, because you see all this unfold on social media. And as a youth, you're constantly, like consuming social media that way. And I feel like, that's what you mean by you know, all that negative energy, they're going to pick it up from there as well. Right? Yeah. And I will have to add that because social media really demands your attention short attention span. So when they discuss geopolitics, or US China rivalry, this tends to be distilled into very short sound bites, that is not historically anchored. And that does not allow for a proper thorough analysis. "
1,0:17,1,Body," So I'm pearls and right as a documentary producer, Executive Producer, what do you think the sino us rivalry has like an impact on the global scale? With regards to how it impacts the globe? And the youth? Right, I think we can. For me, there are two areas that stand out. First is climate change. Like we all care about climate change, right? We've seen so many disasters this year, nonstop, floods, droughts, and US and China, they are the world's number one. And number two, you know, carbon emitters, they need to talk to each other. And I do agree with you on the security aspect of things. Everyone is just more worried about security. And it's not just because of Russia, Ukraine, right in there, aka steel, you have China, increasing their military spending, you have Japan increasing their military spending, India, as well as a long list of other countries. And we just came out of a pandemic. We were the millions of people impoverished during the pandemic, we have to deal with climate change. There are so many other things that we need to address and so much money is going to missiles, firearms, defense, defense."
1,0:18,3,Body,"I think a lot of times the youth are going to think, you know, is war actually going to break out?"
1,0:19,1,Question,"That's how it felt for years, actually, that we've been on the brink. Everyone's saying World War Three war. I always feel like we're on the brink right there. And anytime, if something happens, we could tip over. Do you guys feel the same?"
1,0:20,2,Body,"You know, there was a bit scary a few months ago, but I think that when president Xi and President Biden met in Bali recently, I think everyone heaved a sigh of relief. Yeah, tensions were taken down. I guess people, including us can maybe appreciate the fact that actually despite what is happening, honestly, the likelihood of war taking place here is very, very, at least statistically, historically, we are actually living in one of the most peaceful period, "
1,0:21,1,Question,"I just became very calm. But we're since we're talking about, you know, here, even calm here, right? What does this actually has to do with us and itself? Because, you know, are we ever going to be forced to choose a site like is Austin going to say, you have to pick the US or you have to pick China will ever boil down to that."
1,0:22,3,Body,"For me, I see the choices being made already. US and China is definitely in various guises. They're not telling ASEAN to say choose us or them, but in different domains, say whom you choose, as your 5g network providers, we are already making the choice countries are already making the choice. Even if you do not think of your decision made being choosing us or China, it will be politicized or you will be seen through that lens just simply because this whole choose us or choose them. discourse or narrative has been so strong in this region and and promoted so much by various people. It doesn't help. I guess it helps but it doesn't help in the sense that ASEAN leaders themselves. Keep on harping on the fact that please don't ask us to choose. We don't want to choose repeatedly, nonstop, that becomes a cliche. I do have to add that ASEAN is not Southeast Asia, Southeast Asia is not ASEAN as well. Southeast Asia is a geographical fact. ASEAN is a social historical construct. And sometimes we slip in our language between the two but they're certainly not one in the same Southeast Asian states. B countries in Southeast Asia have their own calculus, they make their own decisions based on whatever national interests work for them, works for the youth, ASEAN collectively makes certain decision, but at the same time, they are also inhibited or to consider what the rest thinks the rest meaning the 10 all collectively 10 member 10 Member States think so I think that the dynamic or there is some distinction between Southeast Asia and ASEAN But to answer your question, countries do not want to choose but in many ways in choosing in the domains of military security, economic home, you do military exercises, more For example, already demonstrates that there are some choices that's been made. But what ASEAN and Southeast Asia does not want to openly do is to make decisions. So overwhelmingly clear that they are on China's side."
1,0:23,2,Body,"Here's also what I've seen in Southeast Asia, like, there are a lot of countries here that maybe they have a security partnership with the US say, Vietnam, for example, um, Vietnam security partnership, they do have a partnership with Japan, not one with the US directly, but then they are also part of the Belt and Road. And like in Cambodia, there's a lot of Chinese investments, but they are also seeking out US investments and US companies. So I think that right now, a lot of Southeast Asian Nations are choosing to encourage projects from both US, China as well as from other powers in order, you know, to maintain that state of balance here,"
1,0:24,1,Question,"but do you think the youths should be concerned about like, you know, all these decisions that are being made, that they maybe they would feel like, you know, I don't have a say in this, you know, does that affect them in any way? Do you think "
1,0:25,3,Body," they really have no say, because let me just put it this way, as Yun remains a very elite activity. For the use of Singapore, for example, popular consciousness of ASEAN is very low. It's just not helped by the fact that when we think about geopolitics, we think about us, China, but very few youths will think about, oh, Indonesian politics method, Malaysian politics matter, ASEAN politics matter. No, these are unfortunately, not the sexy topics that they will consume, not the stuff that generate headlines that will be so that level of awareness of ASEAN is very low, which is unfortunate, because it it does matter as well for for ASEAN itself, or Singapore itself, especially when Singapore very clearly says that ASEAN is a cornerstone of Singapore's foreign policy, but not a lot of youths understand it. And so I think more can be done to encourage mutual understanding of ASEAN countries and the entity itself."
1,0:26,2,Body,"Yeah, I want to add another point, which is that what we are seeing right now, as a result of the US, China, tensions is also a lot of supply chain restructuring. So there's actually a lot of factories, a lot of manufacturing facilities that are opening up all across Southeast Asia, as some companies choose to not have an over reliance on the China market. So they are hiring a lot of young people across Southeast Asia. So this is another way in which geopolitics really affects the young people of Southeast Asia in the employment opportunities as well."
1,0:27,1,Question,"I like the point because I want to bring it back to what Dylan said as well about, you know, Asian politics not being sexy. Right. So what can we do, right to promote the influence of ASEAN, in our institutions, or in Singapore,"
1,0:28,3,Body," I think across ASEAN, there needs to be some sort of curriculum, introduced in your social studies textbooks at the primary, secondary, and then perhaps tertiary level, that at the very least deals a bit more with ASEAN, because these are most immediate neighbors. And they affect us in a multitude of ways. As well, perhaps some, some would even say that equally important, or perhaps more important than us, China as well, because they are our most direct, immediate neighbors. So institutionally, and the level of education, I think more can be done. Next is public awareness. This very podcast, I think, is helpful in that regard. In a way that is not a two minute, two minute social media post, but also speaks at a level that can hopefully connect with the use of Singapore as well, because the use will be as cliche but the US will be the leaders of Singapore in future."
1,0:29,1,Question,"Oh, but it's very tough to get the use of technology. Well, one video is maximum, like, what, three or five minutes? 10 minutes? Okay. 10 minutes. But as you said, politics is not sexy, right? "
1,0:30,2,Body," But I mean, I feel it is fantastic. I don't see why young people are not more engaged with it. It's not as expensive as traveling to all the way to Europe, I certainly don't have to suffer a long flight. And I really think that we should take advantage of that. Culture and vibrancy and beauty all around us and maybe aside from the curriculum, simply more backpacking around the region."
1,0:31,1,Body, I love so you will see that will be your advice to the youth who want to discover more about ASEAN about what it's about to travel and go and figure it out by yourself
1,0:32,2,Body,"for sure. Traveling there talking to the people there. Maybe you might not be immediately interested in politics, you know, but like getting a sense of you know, the economic growth. You know that that culture. And then from there, that's a good segue to understanding the politics of the region as well. And it is very interesting once you get into it. "
1,0:33,1,Body," Honestly, I have never been backpacking through Asia. I have Oh, yeah. Where are you going? I stopped it. This was my first trip. I'll never ever forget it. I've always wanted a backpack. And my mom was like, You're not going alone. I wanted to go from the south of Thailand, go up through Lao, and then go into Hanoi and down all the way to ho Chi Minh. And I found that to be exactly you said, you know, super interesting, because you discover things that you normally wouldn't discover. Super, super fun. And I think this is a good opportunity for us to bring back to AEP Yeah, absolutely. Because not everybody, you know, is the backpacking sort, for example. But the Asia ready exposure program is something that allows the youth to have meaningful exposure to ASEAN states, it gives you that chance, it's a short term program, right? And it gives you cultural exposure, you get industry experience in places like China or India as well. And you get opportunities beyond Singapore. Yeah, I also heard that you can actually meet people who have, you know, been in the industry as well, you can speak to them. And for the youth, this is something that is definitely very eye opening, you know, for me, growing up, I feel like if I had this opportunity, I would definitely jump at it. Because it's like, you know, opportunity to travel opportunity to see ASEAN and be right there. And to experience it firsthand. It's very, very different."
1,0:34,1,Question," So we've talked about, you know, how that affects the youth here in Singapore, right? What about the world globally? How does this, you know, geopolitical situation affect the global situation? "
1,0:35,2,Body," Let me tell you about a group of young people that I interviewed for one of my shows, when US China, tensions became really bad. I went to the States and spoke to China, students who are studying there, the Chinese students form the greatest number of foreign students in the US before the pandemic. So they were in all the different universities and they were paying full fees, okay. And when the geopolitical situation got worst, they had problems with Visa renewals, students that were doing research one day, they were, you know, welcomed to welcome that other day, they were seen as spies and saboteurs. So it's, it's, I feel bad, like, it's been quite difficult, you know, for the China youth that are choosing to study in the US. So they, now a lot of them are looking at other places to pursue their university studies or research programs, which is a pity, I feel that if the geopolitics were not so bad, and relations were better, that definitely the dynamism of the young people of China and the US put together can create some really amazing, you know, scientific breakthroughs and interesting products. "
1,0:36,1,Body,"Yeah, that's a very real problem. I mean, there's situations where we've got Singaporeans working in China that couldn't leave for many years and couldn't see their family for many years. And, and that's because of the policies that are being instituted. Right. I mean, we've spoken a lot, you know, of course, there's more, but I don't think we have one thing in all your studies and all your research about US, China, that is not well known, right, but that you feel people should learn about."
1,0:37,2,Body,"Okay, well, let me tell you about one fun thing. I've been, you know, talking about a lot of serious things. So, young people are all about, you know, exchange programs we love applying for for that right when we're in university. So did you know that when president Xi was young, he was actually on an exchange program to the US. And it was part of the US he went to Iowa. This was when he was already a civil servant. He went to Iowa to learn about farming. And as part of the trip, he stayed in an American citizens home her name is Sarah Lundy. And I know her because I spoke to her and interview her about this incident. And during the time, he stayed in the bedroom of her teenage son, who was away at college and the room was full of Star Wars. And, yeah, interestingly, when he became vice president, he went back to visit that family in Iowa and that house in Muscatine. Iowa has since been turned into a China us Friendship House and Sarah Landay, the lady who hosted him wrote to him and he wrote back and it was carried in Chinese media."
1,0:38,3,Body,"Oh, I had that sitting beings daughter studied at Harvard as well. She had to come back when she became president. For me, I will just share a factoid, small factoid Do you know that? Less than 40% or Americans have passport and less than 10% of Chinese have passports. Now, this tells us several things. One is the amount of people that know what's happening outside of us. And for China, definitely more so as the amount of people in China that knows what's happening outside of China is actually not that great. Second, it means that there is potential, there's scope for more of these sorts of exchanges, people to people exchanges, and hopefully, hopefully that can foster greater mutual understanding on the People to People level as well, between US and China. "
1,0:39,1,Question,because domestically in the US May travel you don't even need a passport next Cash Card yeah so so absolutely I think you know more of the youth globally could afford to travel to learn about the world learn about the cultural and historical historical significance like avery backpacking through all of Asia okay so before we end right let's let's try and do something if you guys have a piece of advice to the youth right so you know on geopolitics what would that be the easiest piece of advice you have for this day and age for the Youth
1,0:40,2,Body,please do not rely on Facebook for news it's really really important to um not be in an echo chamber like toread from a white sauce and if you don't have time to read from everyone at least just read like The you know the local news media and yeah don't don't just depend on your Social Circles for news and information or watch prostarch
1,0:41,1,Body,no absolutely I think an echo chamber can be very dangerous you know moving forward yeah
1,0:42,3,Body,I'm not unlike pearl I would say spend a bit more time reading things and always be questioning questioning the source questioning what's being said um come to your own conclusions after questioning what you read basically fact check yeah yeah 
1,0:43,1,Body,I mean it's surprising that the media is actually coming a lot in our conversation today and looking at you know the intentions of these media sources I think is very important as well you have any advice for these travel um see the world a pulse right you're not gonna get any younger you know in our age people don't really want to step out of their comfort zones and then and take that big leap of faith to say I'm gonna go and travel I'm gonna go and discover the culture myself and I think when people do do that they realize that wow this is amazing like you learn everything firsthand well mine is not as exciting I missed the I missed the exit on the highway and got stuck in Mexico without a passport and got detained in tijuana on it yes that was my experience so.
