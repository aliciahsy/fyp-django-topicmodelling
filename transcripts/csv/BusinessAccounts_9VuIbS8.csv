3	0:01	1	Introduction	"Let's, let's talk business and accountancy. Tonight we have four speakers Nathan, who is senior lead program manager at the Wealth Management Institute, Sean and analysts that shipping and offshore finance credit industrial commercial whaling and internal audit acting manager for Singapore Airlines and Melissa and associate Mercer m&a advisory services. If you guys have any questions during the session, feel free to type in the chat anytime, and we'll try to get our speakers to answer them during the q&a. "
3	0:02	1	Question	"First up, we have Nathan, who is a senior lead program manager at the Wealth Management Institute. Nathan's career is centered around lifelong learning, workforce transformation. And he even sets aside time for community service and undergraduate mentorship. Take it away, Nathan."
3	0:03	2	Body	"Thanks, cyrus. First of all, happy New Year, everybody. And just to do a brief introduction about my my current position, just to provide a bit more context. I'm currently a senior lead program manager doing program development at the Wealth Management Institute. In short, in terms of industry coverage, I think I straddled between both the adult education as well as the financial sector. So if you have any questions about both of these sectors, I'll be able to provide more detail in the q&a later on. Maybe we can have the next slide. Yeah. So with that out of the way, just want to sort of rewind back to the start of my education journey. Before I share a bit more about my career as well. So far, in terms of how I came about deciding what I wanted to study early on, I would say that for me personally, I did focus a lot on passion rather than practicality. And I will say four, there's no right or wrong answer in this space. But just to share a bit more about from from my own journey itself. Since secondary school, I think I've always followed my interests very closely. So even in secondary school, I opted to do double science instead of triple science, because I wanted to do literature, I was always into writing more. And that showed all the way towards University, where at that point of time, I was still not very sure what I wanted to do. But I was very clear that I wanted to follow what I was interested in. So just just to share a bit about myself on that all the way until starting school at NUS. I always thought I would go into econs. But actually, in the first few weeks after going into university, I then decided maybe I'll come to completely something completely different. So I actually went into political science. So just to show you that sometimes, early on, it's very difficult to sort of know exactly what you want to do both for studying as well as for why you want to work at work. "
3	0:04	2	Body	"So that's very normal. And I'll be sharing a bit more about how I came to terms with that myself as well. So why put passion versus practicality because there's always trade off for myself, I think, following my passion has sort of paid off because because of my interest in a subject, it really helped me to excel. And even today, I think, part of the skills that I picked up in political science in NUS, I actually honed my skills in writing, which helped me a lot in my work as well. But I did realize along the way that it is also important to have practical sort of education that is related to your work as well, which is why I decided to do an MBA with Quantic is an online MBA. And I think that really helped me to sort of gap up in terms of the skills and knowledge required in the financial as well as adult education sector. So again, I will say this is my own journey in terms of what what I've come combined in terms of education and for is for yourself to also sort of learn in terms of what what what is really important to you, whether it's passion, practicality, or it could be a mix of both. "
3	0:05	2	Body	"So the second point I want to talk about is about giving it a go and figuring out what you like or even dislike. So why I say dislike is because many of us may find it difficult to sort of pinpoint what we like, especially when it comes to work. But you'll you'll sort of find that or at least for me along the way, when I did internships and different jobs, I actually have a clear idea Why don't like and that's what that's a good place to start, in a sense. So this picture here is actually of the new Ministry of Manpower building, I was actually interning at the Ministry of Manpower at the start of my University. So before that I never thought I would join the public service. But because of my good internship experience, I actually found that it could be a meaningful career. And thereafter, that's where I figured out maybe after graduation, that's where I can start my career in the public service. So that's where I started out. But today I actually moved out of the public service as well. and gone into the private sector. So I will say it's quite fluid in terms of your career as well. "
3	0:06	2	Body	"And that brings me brings me to the next point about how your career narrative can be clearer over time. And with hindsight. So for myself, at least, I realized that after working a bit more and gaining more experience, I realized that looking back, there are some sort of trends or like narratives that I can, that I managed to craft and work out in terms of my career. At the start, it may be difficult to sort of figure that out. But the way how I see is like a on in when you're driving a car, when you look back on your journey, that's where you can see that along the way, at least for me, I realized that the areas that that I really touched on was career workforce development, skills, upgrading, and now into lifelong learning as well. So that's been something that that has been true to me along the way, even in the in the public's service, or even now in the private sector and Wealth Management Institute as well. So I won't go too much into detail into what I want to share in terms of allowing a bit more time for q&a. "
3	0:07	2	Body	"But my last point I want to talk about is about giving back, bargaining more. So I'm very happy to be here today and grateful for NYC and inspirit, inviting me as a panelist because I'm very passionate about youth. So even in my time across my education and career, I've always been volunteering in youth related areas. So I was quite involved in boys brigade. And even in my university University years, I did a lot of volunteer work, even in the overseas community involvement program, which I learned a lot, leading my own team there. Today, I still continue to volunteer and mentoring the undergraduates at NUS and my faculty at Arts and Social Sciences. So I will say that it's not just about me giving back but it's gaining more of it, I always tell my mentees that I hope I also always aim to learn from them as well. So there's a lot for us to continue to learn. And for me learning has always been a key point in my education and career journey."
3	0:08	2	Body	"And just to move on to the second slide I have, I won't go too much into all the questions, but I just thought since we only have about five minutes to share, I will just put a cheat sheet here in case there are some burning questions you may have related. And I'll be happy to sort of answer in more detail later on. But just to leave everybody with a quote from Steve Jobs to Stay hungry, stay foolish because for me, I think that that has been true to me through my education and career journey. And please feel free to link up with me on LinkedIn, happy to provide any further advice or questions or answer questions that you may have, even after this session that we have. So thanks, everybody, I'll hand the time back to Cyrus."
3	0:09	1	Question	"Thanks, Nate and I have to contribute back to the community okay in the future too. And I'm also a political science major, right now. Next up, we have Shan Shan is an analyst at shipping and offshore finance credit. Sorry, it's French finance, credit industrial agriculture. He obtained his bachelor's degree in business management finance at SMU where he found his calling in the banking sector. On to you, Sean."
3	0:10	3	Body	"Thanks, Iris, if you could go to the first light. Okay, so I chose to focus a bit more on my last education rather than the years before, you'd see that I studied SMU and I did business management, I chose to major in finance, I thought it might be interesting to touch on just very briefly what that's about and why I chose that which might be of more value to you. So to put it very simply, business management is, as the name says about managing business. So it covers all aspects of things like marketing. So you think about your advertisements and your promotions, that's part of business management. Think about operations and logistics, how to move your product from one place to another how much warehouse space you need. That's also a business decision. And it's covered in this course, HR is beyond human resources, the most important tool and resource that a company has finances is about managing your money and entrepreneurship, how to better run startups or cultivate startup culture. So all that goes into a business management degree, and I chose to major in finance, and get into that later. "
3	0:11	3	Body	"But I wanted to talk about why business first, which I think some of you were keen to ask. I'm one of those who did not actually know exactly what I wanted to do when I stepped foot into uni. And I thought that business would be a degree that kept a lot of doors open for me. And that experience has been true for me so far. Because I couldn't do it on something that I was very interested in. But what I could do was to Get more doors open and just shut those doors that I knew I really didn't want to do. For example, I really didn't want to do law. So don't even talk about that just just shut that door and keep the other doors that I don't mind doing open. And I think that works well, especially when you know that there are some areas that you're just not so good at, I have myself many of those weakness areas, well don't, don't shine on that don't do, don't do something that requires heavy use of those weak areas, use areas that you don't mind or areas that you're stronger in. So play to your strengths. And with that, let's go on to my working experience. So I graduated just about coming to five years now. And I've been with my companies, it's a French bank, the name is CIC or credit, industrial, commercial, there's a French name. I currently work in the front office, which just means it's a client facing role. And I help my team to bring in new business deals, because we do business, we need business deals. And, again, I'd like to talk a bit about why I chose that. Now, when I was at SMU, I had the privilege of doing an internship in another bank, a Japanese bank at the time. And it was very fortunate because I realized that I could sit down as an intern and watch my colleagues, my seniors, my bosses run their day, and I could just watch how they live their lives. Watch what they did, and ask myself, Is this something I can do? And fortunately, because I reached the answer that yes, this is something I can do. I don't mind doing this. And again, it played to my strengths. I don't do well on a environment that's heavily focused on numbers, or heavily focused on writing. I do well in environments that have a good balance of that. And of course, an environment that does require a fair bit of human interaction. I'm in client facing role now after all, so there is a fair bit of human interaction involve. And there's a good balance of all that where I am. And of course, it happens that I picked up French for some years. So being in a French bank, and having this third language did help. It's not a requirement, but it does help. So again, a judgment at that point, I'm trying to drive through it I'm trying to give you which is that you definitely have strengths, find them, use them, you definitely have weaknesses, and that's okay, so do it. Well, don't play so big on your weaknesses, don't do something that amplifies your weaknesses, but keep your doors open. So I'll end off with a couple of questions or pointers on your third column, which is the Ask Me Anything column. Now, feel free to ask me about the business degree or how if you'd like any tips on how to choose your education, your career, asked me about banking and personal work life in general, I think all of us are very happy to answer that. Having been in the workforce for a while, we can answer your questions. With that. I think that's all I like to say, please feel free to reach out to me more for the q&a, or reach out to all of us, actually, Cyrus back to you."
3	0:12	1	Question	"Thanks, Shawn. I'm learning a lot about managing my strengths and weaknesses and business degrees today. Though the we have wedding, she's an internal audit acting manager for Singapore Airlines. Whaling has also worked as a internal and external auditor for firms like KPMG. Go ahead, waiting."
3	0:13	4	Body	"Thanks, Iris. Hi, everyone. My name is Wei Ling, and I'm currently at Singapore Airlines. If you could move to the next slide, please. Okay, so talking a little bit about my journey to share? Well, I took on a degree in accountancy from NTU. Not really, because I had a specific passion or any major they are interested in. Contrary to that, I did not have any interest or passionate that type videos, okay, you know, getting past the levels. All right, getting into university, and what do I do next? It was solely based on my parents recommendation, that, Oh, you know, being an accountant is an iron rice bowl. If the company closes down, we'll be the last people. So you know, thinking that there'll be a lot of job security, I went into this field. And thereafter, I follow the normal path of accounting graduate, to get all of my peers, I went into one of the big four. And I spent about one and a half years of their "
3	0:14	4	Body	"life in Big Four is very fun. You have a lot of peers of the same age group and the big four firms to organize many, many activities to engage the staff. I also do acknowledge that there is a great exposure. I was exposed to multiple different industries and also clients as part of external auditing. I think the cons everybody is fairly familiar, that they are long, grueling hours when working at Big Four. I'm not sure about now, but when I was there many, many years ago, those were the norm. And as I approached util, and after one and a half years, I felt that I was losing myself that you know, I'm doing something which I'm fairly good at, but it's not something that I enjoy. To set in, and it's also something that I cannot see myself doing for the next three to five years. And that is where I sort of enter into sort of more darker heights, I will say, in my career, where I find myself last. You know, I couldn't tell where my passions were. And to be honest, I also didn't know what was the right career for me. Because like I mentioned, going into accounting wasn't something that I was passionate about. So the good thing was, I took a break from work, and also the time where, you know, I got married, and I went on a pretty long overseas trip, because of my husband's overseas job posting. And that is where over the year, I really sit down and talk to myself to determine what exactly is it I want in life. Thereafter, I also talked about thought about when you're going to contract teaching, which I did a brief stint of really seeking that just to understand how it's going. I also got into a brief temporary job of an accountant, as well as operations at one housing bought, you know, just to give myself exposure. And all these were temporary stints given that I didn't want myself to be, you know, permanently in any role until I shot myself out. And by the end, actually, I did a good stocktake of you know, what I like what I disliked and what I'm good at. And at this point, I realized that you know, I'm pretty good at processes, even though I have a degree in accounting numbers is probably not something that I want to pursue. On top of it, I find that, you know, I'm fairly detailed, and I can delve in to find out issues. "
3	0:15	4	Body	"So thereafter, I launched myself into a career of internal audit, after consulting a couple of peers that are working in the industry. And also, you know, discussion with friends who are in external audit, as well as internal audit as well. And that is where I happened to join Sia. And I'm approaching my 10th year here. So it's been a pretty long journey with SIA, I started off my career in Singapore Airlines as an internal auditor. And during my seventh year, I got an opportunity to be seconded out to the Transformation Office, and thereafter to global and corporate sales. Yesterday, I officially returned back to internal audit, again, to continue my career here. I would say working in Sia, has been truly very fortunate. I found a company where you know, not only the career, which I'm passionate about, which I finally found, and also a company that resonates with me in terms of my values. So I would think is a place that I will probably stay for long. And yeah, so you know, looking at this entire journey, I would say, you know, don't be too afraid. You know, when you're lost to your teeth, just take a pause and, you know, do an internal structure and rationalization. And eventually you definitely get yourself out of the woods. Alright, thanks so much. Back to you Sarah's"
3	0:16	1	Question	"thanks for sharing such a personal experience with us. I'm sure learning about how you find yourself will help everyone here on their journey to self discovery to last but not least, we have Melissa Melissa is an associate and Mercer m&a advisory services. Melissa advises clients with regard to transactions involved in merger and acquisitions. Take it away, Melissa. Thanks, Iris."
3	0:17	5	Body	"Hi, everyone. My name is Melissa. A little bit about myself. I'm currently a consultant with about eight years of working experience. My areas of expertise are mergers and acquisition and human capital consulting. education background wise, I studied accountancy in NTU. So similar to Shawn and wheeling, when it came to deciding my university degree, I was also one of those students that didn't have a clear passion or direction in terms of what it was I wanted to pursue for my career. So I think what I wanted to do was just keep the most number of options available for myself. So in that sense, personally, I would recommend for those of you who are in the same boat as where we were previously, if you don't really find yourself not having a clear passion or clear direction in life, perhaps you might want to consider choosing something that keeps the most number of doors open for you. So what I did was I did accountancy, because simply because of that practical reason. Yeah. "
3	0:18	5	Body	"My take on university days is that university is really the time for you to find out what it is that suits you and your interests. So most of the time it's really up About just blindly stabbing in the dark. So going through a different industry that you may be interested in going into a firm that you may be interested in, just do as many internships as you can possibly do. The path really gets clear over time. I think the benefit of being a student and being young is that people actually gives you a lot of opportunities people take you on just because you have a good attitude. Just because you have a good learning law, you just have a good learning attitude. So I would recommend kind of getting your foot in the door by doing internships as soon as possible. For me, I did two internships during my university days, both in consulting i Even though I did accountancy, after speaking with my seniors who are doing audit or doing accountancy, I realized that the long hours like what reading say, it's not really something that I really want. Okay, the long hours with low pay is not really something that I want. So I think that, for me was like kind of like a deal breaker. So I decided to do consulting as my internship and state. So this consultant, these consulting internships helped me understand that this was actually a career I wanted to pursue. So in terms of working experience, I'm currently in the m&a advisory team in Mercer. So what m&a means is basically just mergers and acquisition or companies that acquire, If a company wants to acquire another company, they then they will come to us for advice in terms of human capital issues. So my team does both the preview and post the work, which essentially just means PDU being things like due diligence, where we do like investigative work, to investigate possible issues that may pose as roadblocks to a company wanting to close the sale of another company. And when we look at post view work, which will be things like a post merger integration, where we look at what are some of the things that should be done after a company decides to buy another company. So this is essentially what I've been doing. For my working experience so far. And to someone I've been in consulting for my entire career. Although I initially studied accountancy, I'm actually not a practicing accountant or auditor. And my main message to everyone here is that university degree is really just a stepping stone to your career. And it's important to have as many options and keep your doors open as much as possible. Yeah.Cyrus I think that's it from my end."
3	0:19	1	Introduction	"Oh, I see. We wish you all the best. Thank you. But yes, thank you, everyone, for sharing your personal journeys with us. I'm sure all of us have much to learn from your examples. Now moving on to the q&a portion. We have some questions from the padlet. If you guys have any questions you would like to ask our speakers, please feel free to type in the chat or unmute your mic to ask. Yes. So I'll kick start the q&a portion of the questions person the better."
3	0:20	1	Question	" To start off as a general question. Let me see. Okay, I guess we can take this question like and go one round. Is there any skills we need to have in order to pursue business and accountancy in university? Yes. Melissa, would you like to start seeing other accountancy students?"
3	0:21	5	Body	"I would say to be honest, not really, because I mean, I think each of the different universities have their requirement, which is I think you need to at least do math. I think that's a requirement. But I think you need to be comfortable with numbers. You might you don't have to be the best at numbers, but you need to have a general sensibility when it comes about today. Yeah."
3	0:22	1	Body	"Shauna willing, you have any input on the topic?"
3	0:23	4	Body	"Okay, maybe I'll go first. I also don't think there's like a prerequisite going to accounting. Basically, definitely some form of numbers, because a couple of modules would cover that. My thing, language skills is probably one of it as well, because there will be a couple of writing modules. Last but not least, I've been out of school for quite a while, but I heard you know, computing is also one of the basic requirements in accounting now for data analytics. So I mean, if you're strong in debt counting, it does cover that as well. And it's one of the special specialties that you go into."
3	0:24	2	Body	"Yeah, me I'll just provide my my own input in terms of what I did for MBA, I guess, for myself, I've always been very clear about my interests and my strengths. So just to share when I was doing the MBA, there was an accountancy module as well. And, and that was the one that I dragged my feet, because I'm not a very numbers person. So I do agree with Melissa wailing, you have to be quite comfortable with that. But even so I will say business has more than that. And there's a lot of other interesting topics, like the organizational development part, which I was very interested in. So depending on which you focus on, that can also bring you through the whole program as well."
3	0:25	3	Body	" So we've we've heard quite a bit on the accountancy side, and this, of course, will support your mobile business. So I guess that's the business degree guy. Let me have a few words on the business side. Do you need any particular skills? I would say no. Because business is, by nature, quite a general degree. As I mentioned, just now, there's a lot of fields, right, you've got the HR side, and that covers organizational development as well, you've got the finance side. So I'm already listing one that is quite low numbers, and one that is quite heavy on the numbers. So you don't have to necessarily be a numbers Pro to step into business first, you know, it's only later on, we're going to choose your major at the end of year two and unique that, okay, if you're strong in numbers, then maybe you want to go further into the finance side. If not, there's no reason to worry, there's at least five other fields of business you can go into. So I would say what you've already been covering in your school should be enough. You know, if you're on the JC side, the subjects there, you should have enough poli sci similar story. We've seen many candidates come from both backgrounds, from many other backgrounds as well. And you will already have what it takes to step foot into business. And especially for the first two years we are covering the more University core modules you have what it takes us those core modules to then discover what particular skills that you want to get deeper into. There'll be my take on it."
3	0:26	1	Question	"Thank you speakers. Moving on to another question, how is the working life like in terms of working our stress level and salary? I think it's a general question that you can tackle. So so maybe we want to start with weiling."
3	0:27	4	Body	"Okay, maybe I start from big for external auditors, I guess like what Melissa mentioned, and start again, with a pretty low base. That is typically how the Big Four work previously, or the Big Four has pretty standard starting pay throughout, I guess a PWC, slightly above the rest slightly. But generally quite competitive. Long hours, a bit of differences between the Big Four by generally fairly long hours, also depends a little bit of your luck, which team you're in. But of course, that being said, if if you have about two to three years of experience in Big Four,  you experience a pretty big leap thereafter. Either if you stay or if you go, there will be a leap in salary and leap in position as well. And a lot of people go into big folder after pursue various careers including consultancy, including being a finance manager, etc. So there is one aspect of it. Currently, my life in Singapore Airlines as an internal auditor, I will say I have a pretty good work life balance. I have to get swipe at SIA. So yeah, and pay wise, I think it's okay. It doesn't really pay you exorbitantly well, like banks, but it's pretty okay. I think you survived. Definitely. Alright, back to the rest."
3	0:28	1	Body	Anyone else want to share the data?
3	0:29	2	Body	"Okay, um, for my current position, now, I am actually much more busy. I would say it's not, not really so much a factor of the industry. But more so because my organization is quite small. So there's only about 50 of us. So each of us actually have to pull quite a bit of our weight. And at certain points of time, I do feel like I could even be a one man show doing certain programs. But that's where I also enjoy it. And I learned a lot more. So that's where you saw have to compare between working in a smaller organization as well as a bigger one. But just a bit about maybe the difference between like public or private sector, I think sorting out in public service was quite good, because in terms of salary package, it's quite competitive. And for guys, they actually do consider your NS experience as well. So that's a big plus point now, but on the flip side, public service in terms of the progression and salary and all that is pretty sort of structured. So if you want to move quickly, right, then I would say the private sector will enable you to do that a lot faster. So for myself, at least, I was quite blessed because in terms of my career transitions, I was sort of headhunted along the way. So each time I've never had to actually take a pay cut when I move along law and sort of self promote myself. Yeah. So I will say currently my work life balance not so good compared to the past definitely. But I think having a good boss helps. So my boss is really very outcome focused. So she gives me the leeway to do the work as and when I want to, and it helps having a young child I can sort of plan my time. Next well,"
3	0:30	1	Body	"Melissa or Shawn, do you have any? Do you have any interesting points about your salary or your work life balance?"
3	0:31	5	Body	" I guess I can, I mean, I guess I can add on here, which is that I think, as fresh graduates it to be, I don't think you should shy away from hard work. To be honest, I'm just going to take a different approach here and just say that, I think, as a first graduate, work life balance, shouldn't be the first thing that you consider reason being, because I think every role expects the most junior person on the desk to work the hardest. So I think, across whichever industry is in whichever job or whichever company it is that you join. I just think that having a good learning attitude is something that's very important. And as a junior with perhaps not that much to contribute in terms of content knowledge, really, what you can contribute is in terms of pulling up the slack. So that will mean putting in the late hours. So I think what matters is really more for you to think about whether this is this there is something in it in the long term for you. So like, is it worth it putting the long hours now, for something that you actually want to pursue in the future? Yeah, so that's my take on it."
3	0:32	3	Body	"But I'll add on to that as well. I think you went out when I was graduating as well, I got I faced the same question. I was asking the same question as well, like, Hey, how are the working hours like, but you realize, once you step foot into work, that you can't run away from it, no matter where you go, at least for some seasons, long hours to come and find you, I can almost guarantee that. If it's no longer hours, then it's intense days, pick your poison, but there will definitely my point is there will definitely be hard times and long hours can be one of those. So let me put in a word on on how it is like for banking? The answer is it really depends. In my current role is a client facing job? Well, we do need to respond, we very responsive to the client's request and client demands and clients needs as well. If a deal is rushed in insist recommend we do put in those hours to make it happen fast. So that already is a bit of a variance a bit of dynamic, hard to predict kind of model in terms of working hours. So I will say from my experience, yes, there are days that are longer hours, there are days that I do, I don't really have to OT much at all. So it does vary. But I do like what Melissa said, which is that, try and have in mind, this is a short term, understand it is a short term pain. Think about more how you angle it for the future like you at this point in time. If you're at work, maybe you have a better idea on what this industry is about. And you're asking yourself, okay, am I willing to do this for the short term bear in the short term pain for long term benefits, because it's better for me in future? And I think that's probably the healthier mindset to go. But really don't don't don't shy away from long hours just because it does sound difficult. And of course, it's uncomfortable. You can't run away from it. Every industry out there, it will come and find you. If you don't get long hours, then you get very intense working with at least which is also not comfortable. Yeah."
3	0:33	2	Body	" Yeah, maybe just to debunk the part about public service, that there are sort of requirements to work long hours as well. In fact, my first job doing a policy work pro and Workforce Development Agency, there were days that I worked past 12 as well. So it's not always true that public service has a better work life balance. It really depends on the role, the department, the organization, the size of your team, even a boss one so far, so there are a lot of factors."
3	0:34	1	Question	"Thank you, speakers. Okay, so we have a question from the chat about accountancy and business management degrees keeping both are keeping the door open. What then should we consider we're trying to decide between the two? I think, Melissa, can that go this? Do you have like, any unique points to talk about here? Cause Yeah."
3	0:35	5	Body	"Okay, so for me, I actually did accountancy. Reason being because like I said, I didn't want to close off as many doors as possible, right? So with a business degree, you can't go into accountant. You can't be an internal auditor or you can't be an accountant. But in NTU, if you did accountancy for the first year, it's actually still possible for you to switch the degree after that to do business in the second year if you actually are interested. So I really went with it was the most practical mindset of all, which is to keep your options open as much as possible. And doing accountancy still gives you the opportunity to go into the same fields for business. Eventually if you decide during your degree At some point that you don't wish to do it, but if you start off with a business degree, you won't be able to make that transition. So that was my take on it. But I'm not sure if that's like the rest of the speakers would agree with. There's never anything to add on for this question."
3	0:36	3	Body	"I think in terms of keeping doors open, my humble opinion is that yes, accountancy does give you a few models, the business doesn't. So I'm in agreement with Melissa, I will also add on one other angle to look at it, which is that so what we just talked about is a bit more on okay, what do you do after you graduate? Right, so my next point will be so what you do when you're still studying Accountancy degree will simply have more accountancy modules, because at its core, it is an Accountancy degree. So you will have simply more, probably more numbers there, you will be studying more numbers, so to speak, whereas business, you'd have the luxury to? Well, don't take the numbers module once you're done with the initial bit. So I would add that as my two cents, Think also about what you want to do during your three, four years of study. And then also consider then what I've been saying, which is, okay, so what happens after those three, four years, then do you want a few models open? Are you are you willing to let go of those few models and go with business?"
3	0:37	1	Body	"Thanks, Melissa, Thanks, Shawn. Oh, sorry. "
3	0:38	2	Body	"Just Just a thought I put forth the observation I have about my my batch from political science, I noticed half of them actually went to public service, and the other half went to the private sector. So I would say and I had a friend personally, she did double major, both political science and business. So I think that helped her to get a role in the financial sector. So also, depending on which sector you're looking to go into, I would say, if you're looking at private sector related business degree will probably give you a better edge. Whereas if you did something like a social science degree like me, then maybe public service will sort of be a better alignment in certain sense, but doesn't mean you will be completely closed off. It's just that the way that employers view you may be slightly different. And then you have to sort of craft your your narrative. And also, depending on what you did, in school outside of studies itself, yeah."
3	0:39	1	Question	"Thank you. Thank you, everybody. So moving on to another question from the Padlet. What are some qualities that you hope to see in future leaders as people who have more senior ranking now, what do you hope to see from your juniors who are entering the workforce? Yes. Maybe we can start from Nathan."
3	0:40	2	Body	"Yep. So for me, I would say, what I will look for is really somebody who's a self starter. I'm the sort of, I guess you'll learn along the way as well, in terms of how you work with different bosses. But for me, I'm very much more outcome focused. So if there's somebody that is sort of supporting me, in my role, I really like the person to be able to figure things out themselves, in a sense, when I tell them, I'm looking at this outcome. I really sort of don't care how you get to that outcome, but we'll be able to figure it out along the way, and what's the best way to do it? So I will say, self-starter willingness to learn and a very good attitude, which is I think what Melissa and Shawn mentioned earlier, they're very important."
3	0:41	1	Body	Does anyone else have any expectations for like someone like me who will be entering the workforce soon ish?
3	0:42	5	Body	"Yeah, I actually do have an artery that I would. So I actually look out for when we look at recruiting interns or whatsoever, and it's actually resourcefulness. So I think, good learning attitude aside, that's, that's honestly one of the most important thing and most of the time when we when you join a new team, the seniors on a desk don't expect you to come with any knowledge. Because, like I say, the best thing about being young is that people give you opportunities. But I think when you are able to demonstrate resourcefulness, I think that's very critical. Because it when you are responsible, when you're resourceful, you're able to do something faster, right? Perhaps even though you're new to it, because it is able to think about new ways or faster ways of doing something. So that actually puts you in better state in terms of accomplishing more tasks. So if you think about it in an internship, you have like three months to like impress your boss, right? So if you're able to do something faster, they will just give you more things to do. So in that way you actually gain more experience. So I think if you are able to really learned that resourcefulness thing, it actually helps yourself better."
3	0:43	4	Body	"Yeah. Maybe I'll add on I feel with Madison resourcefulness, I think that is one of the traits that we look at, gather to trace and look for creative thinking, as well as being a good team player. I think particularly in today's environment, things move very fast. So I require people to think out of the box and you know, sometimes surprised me with solutions. And you know, today we're talking about things like agile, everything design thinking. These are just concepts which everybody can regurgitate. But I need somebody who can really deploy the creative thinking, and to come up with solutions that are workable, realistic. And, you know, to give a fresh perspective, I think that is very valuable to me. The second thing about teamwork is, in my aspect of work, we do work in teams. Having one strong person versus a strong team, a strong team definitely works better, putting a lot of heads together. So if you can work together as a team, I think it's going to be very tough in the workforce. And it's going to be quite disastrous in terms of networking as well. So I think teamwork definitely is another trick that I look for when I recruit staff."
3	0:44	3	Body	"And I'll just touch on one quality that I would stress. It's not about technical skills, or a particular con, what content or content knowledge or domain knowledge, it would be more of people management, or you might call it people skills, if you like, in my experience, I mean, some parts of the job, you might need your technical skills. But so far, my opinion is that people management is the hardest part of the job. Because in your role, you may be constrained by having to deal with difficult clients. But at the same time you are kind of by your boss are internal constraints. And all these people, all of these people need to manage this, right, because you need to get the job done at the end of the day. So it requires a good balance of knowing what works for you. It covers things like when you're meeting someone new, making good impressions, it covers things like when you're working day to day with your teammates, build good relationships with them. Remember, that's very, very important. departments that you don't necessarily work with. Also build very good relationships with them, because you might need them one day. And when push comes to shove, knowing what resources you can tap on knowing that, hey, this, but I should reach out to that person that team because they're really helpful. Oh, this person actually is not the most helpful type. But I really need their help. How do I get them to help me. And a lot of these are very, very tricky situations that you don't always have the luxury of time to think about. But that just stressing the point that people skills are very, very important. For me, I dare say possibly the hardest and most hardest part, the job and the most important part the job."
3	0:45	1	Question	"Okay, thank you, speakers. Um, I just got a question from the chat also from et Shah. Or just a reminder, please don't pm the any of us questions. So like, the whole zoom session can see it. But I'll just read out the question. If I get a business degree from a local uni majoring in finance, where I'm here to work in Australia, or uk If required, maybe Melissa will know bit more, because you're going to sorry, I know it's a bit of a stretch, but he's overseas."
3	0:46	5	Body	" Okay, well, that's okay, I'm not entirely sure about Australia. But I have friends that have actually relocated to Australia to work? And I would say, I would say definitely, yes, it's possible. To be honest. Once you start walking with a few years of experience under your belt, the university degree starts to matter less and less, where you get your university degree starts to matter less and less, because people are more interested to find out what it is that you have been doing during your career. So I would say if you're looking to relocate immediately post graduation, that might be slightly difficult, because I understand that you will be competing with the local pool of graduates in Australia. So if I am an employer in Australia, I don't see an added benefit in paying for your relocation from Singapore to Australia, when I can directly hire a fresh graduate in Australia with perhaps the same degree. But if you're talking about relocating post working so like, for myself, I'm relocating to Hong Kong after working in Singapore for about eight years. So I think in that case, definitely the doors are still open, you can definitely still relocate to Australia or New Zealand or or on, I would say, within Asia, it should be fairly, it should be fairly doable, because people are starting to focus less on where you got your particular degree, but what your experience is, yep."
3	0:47	1	Question	"Thank you for this. We have another question from the chat. Is it very hard to switch careers do we have to study from scratch again, I'm assuming it's within the business and accountancy industry. So if, for example you're trying to switch from, I think the speakers that got it earlier, right? Correct. Was it wedding was talking about a competency? Or was it Shawn? Yeah. Like, if you think we lived experience is kind of formed to this, right?"
3	0:48	4	Body	"Yeah. So. So I think, switching careers, you don't have to study from scratch. I'm not sure whether the other three speakers will agree with me, basically, what I have studied in accounting, maybe I only use 10% in my work. In terms of like, the soft skills, like what Shawn Melissa and later mentioned, does have people management, change management, source winners, all those, I think, are more key to be successful in every single career. Even today, I have auditors under me, who started off as engineers who started off in operations. And actually I do fairly well in internal audit, even though they do not have a degree in accounting. But the attitude again, it's very important for you to succeed. And technical skills can always be picked up on the job. It's really the soft skill set that makes the difference. So I would say you definitely wouldn't have to start from scratch."
3	0:49	2	Body	"Yeah, maybe to add a different perspective. If the question is sort of a bit broader in terms of switching careers to more sort of technical or professional careers like law, then in certain instances, you do sort of have to gap up in terms of your your study. So I have friends who, who, after political science degree, they went to do masters in law so that they can sort of be practicing lawyers. So there are instances where you might need to do some studying, depending on the career looking at. But I think, by and large, if you are looking at the space, within the industry, or even across the industry, that is sort of quite similar to what you've been working at. Seldom you will need to really do sort of additional studies, like for me, myself, I will say is a lot more about my personal development rather than a need to actually do an MBA. But I will say it gives me an edge in terms of being able to then bring it back to my work as well. So I guess that's a different angle, not so much about whether you you have to study, but whether you you does help you in your career, ultimately, as well."
3	0:50	1	Question	" Thank you. And we have another question from the chat from See, would it be worth it to pursue a business degree, so it wouldn't be worth it to proceed business degree if one only has has a strong interest, such as marketing, or HR, which seems to be only around 1/3 of the entire business curriculum? Maybe Shawn, do you think you can tackle this question? Sure."
3	0:51	3	Body	"First of all, congrats, you're probably better than most of us, you actually know what you want to do. Congrats on that it's a very, very good thing to have. My My answer would be in your case, if you already have if you already know you have a strong interest, then please pursue it. You don't have to follow us and like just keep the doors open, because you already know what you want to zero into. By all means, it's still worth it. If you ask me. I might say that the weightage of you know, marketing or HR modules is more than a third one is probably your university core modules. So the ones you have to do no matter what you're going to major in, but actually more weight on it, probably two thirds will be slightly more than that. Now, those that two thirds is your marketing or your HR modules. So I would say it is worth it. If that is your experience. "
3	0:52	1	Question	"Thank you, Shawn. Okay, we have another question. One of the speakers mentioned that data analytics is for accounting. Does it involve programming? And is it covered during the costs?"
3	0:53	4	Body	" I think there will be Cyrus. Yeah. Yeah. So just to emphasize, I think audit is moving, we are moving to what we call continuous auditing. Where data analytics is continuous and automatic. We are also moving to automatic testing as well. So these are the things going on in the industry. And involves programming to in a very basic sense. I'm not a programmer, but there are tools out there that doesn't require you to have programming skills. But definitely programming skills is very helpful. And I do understand today in accounting, there are computing courses included in the curriculum based on people I've recruited recently, and you can also pursue a minor as well in programming. So just to share I have a staff previously that was very interested in computing. So he mastered python and SQL. And it was indeed a very useful skill that you can use in auditing. You could do even basic programming for you to do certain data analysis and scripting for data extraction, which is very relevant in the audit industry today. So I think if you're keen on learning more about data and analytics, and keen in a career in accounting, I will definitely say dA is one of the things to look out for in the cloud in the Nordics, as well as external audit if I'm not wrong."
3	0:54	2	Body	"Yeah, when I was at IBM, the Institute of banking and finance, I was actually working on this report that is already published this about how data analytics and automation impacts jobs in the financial sector. I'll put the link in the chat. But it's a very long report. But basically, the point is that jobs are changing quite a bit because of data analytics automation, do take a bit of time to just read the executive summary, and you realize that a lot of roles are being much instead of disappearing because of the impact of technology. So as wailing mentioned, it is good to sort of pick up some of these skills, but also what Shawn mentioned is very true. Even as things become more automated, actually, the people skills become even more important, because these can be taken over by machines. So do take a look at the report when you have time."
3	0:55	1	Question	"Okay, we have one during the end of the session. So if we can only take one, one question before we go for closing remarks. Or maybe we can do a speed round. Okay, I see. I'll just read out vowels question first minute, what is the importance of a degree in the Speaker's respective industries? I have a polytechnic friend that is planning to stop the education pathway at the diploma stage and does not wish to further their education to get degree. Is this concerning? Actually, there's a bit of a personal age to this question, does anyone have any advice to offer to this? Person?"
3	0:56	4	Body	"Really, I'll give my two cents worth. So I think it really depends on where in the end, you want to go. Depending on organization, if I'm not wrong, the public service where you enter, really looks at your credentials, in terms of very degree, certain more traditional companies as well. But I would say that there are some people who are really very hands on. And even though they are armed with just a diploma, they go on to do very, very well, much better than people with degrees. And they tend to do a bit better, and more advanced in certain type of companies that are less traditional. And little bit of how to say, more outcome driven, and results driven rather than basing everything on your credentials. So it really depends on which company in which type of sector they're going to pursue."
3	0:57	2	Body	"It will add a bit on financials sector, I would say across the board for financial sector, they do look after a degree. But that being said, I would say there are those who join with a diploma and then they do a part time degree and then from then they move on. So that's another option as well. I always find studying, there's always a trade off. Because if you study longer than there's lesser time to join the workforce, and actually what experience in a sense, sometimes it's actually more important than then something itself. So it depends. But I would say if at least for financial sector, a degree definitely helps a lot."
3	0:58	1	Close	"Okay, thank you, everybody. I think we've officially run out of time for questions. But yes, thank you, everyone who's asked questions. And if possible, I think for the remaining questions, we have tried to get the answer to words to everyone, somehow Sure. Publicity or other materials. But yes. Okay. Thank you all for speakers for coming down tonight and share your experiences with anyone here before we end up the q&a segment. Do you guys have any closing remarks for the attendees? Okay, if not, could I just get everyone to thank them by either typing things in the chat box or by showing a thumbs up or plus reaction? For all of you found it very helpful. Now on to the final part of the top Janani will be giving the closing remarks and closing administrative methods for this session. Is"
